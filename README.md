# About 

    A app which has has the aspirational goal of allowing character creation for Dungeons & Dragons 5e. Through my experience of running games on digital tabletops I found the current market options for hosting limited and restrained. This platform is tailored for creation of characters in my homebrew world. Giving a detailed and bespoke language selection component as well as custom skills. This app will eventually allow players to log in and save characters to there profiles as well as providing a space for players to communicate through posts, provide notications with regards to player games and store journal notes. Yes this is to say I will eventually host my Dungeons and Dragons games on this platform!
